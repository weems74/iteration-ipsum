# Incident Ipsum
Ipsum generator that creates text relevant to IT incidents/outages.

An adaptation of the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLS4Hk-kJXE

## Modifications to above tutorial
* Used translated lorem ipsum to have an English base.
* Displayed just the "translated" words rather than the original and the translated word
* Added randomizer so not every word gets translated, so you have some semblance of a sentence
* Added test for capitalization so if the original words starts a sentence, the replacement word is capitalized
* Output to terminal rather than creating a new file.
* Preserved basic verbs so that there's more of a chance for real independent clauses matching the structure of the original.

## Example output:
`Baseline Threads must explain Lambda mount fatal microservice this mistaken isolating of API pleasure integration praising pain was born.
